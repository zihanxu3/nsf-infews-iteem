To facilitate understanding and decision making in the food-energy-water (FEW) nexus context, we develop an integrated technology-environment-economics model (ITEEM) at a watershed scale. ITEEM is built as an inte- gration of various models, including models for grain processing, drinking water treatment, and wastewater treatment (technology); a watershed model for hydrology, water quality, crop production, and nutrient cycling (environment); an economics model assessing total benefit, including non-market valuation of environmental benefits. Different data techniques are applied to develop suitable surrogates for computer-based models, including a response matrix method, artificial neural networks, and lookup tables. Empirical equations are applied to develop models of economics and drinking water treatment. The input-output relationships between the models are formulated in a unified computational framework. ITEEM, a spatially semi-distributed dynamic simulation model, can be used to quantify the environmental and socioeconomic impacts of various management practices, technologies, and policy interventions on FEW systems in the Corn Belt.
